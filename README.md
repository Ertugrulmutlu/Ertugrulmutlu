# 👋 Hi, I’m Ertugrul Mutlu

I work on **machine learning systems and agentic AI**, with a focus on **scalability, monitoring, and human supervision** in real-world environments.

Currently, I am a **Computer Engineering student at RWTH Aachen University** and a **Werkstudent Researcher at Fraunhofer IAIS**, contributing to applied research on agent-based AI workflows and ML systems.

## 🔍 Interests & Focus

* Agentic AI & Human/Agent-in-the-Loop systems
* ML Systems, monitoring, and reliability
* Edge AI & embedded systems
* Practical system design over abstract theory

## 🧪 What I build

* End-to-end ML pipelines (data → model → evaluation → deployment)
* Agent-based systems with feedback loops and supervision
* Edge AI projects on microcontrollers and low-resource devices
* Educational and tooling prototypes for clearer system understanding

## 🎤 Talks & Writing

* **From Human-in-the-Loop to Agent-in-the-Loop** — DataTalks.Club
* Technical blog posts on ML systems, agentic AI, and applied research
